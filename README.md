# my_blockchain
I decided to build a blockchain of my own from scratch because I have nothing else to do in Spring break.

Starting off with python because you don't need a brain to use python. Hopefully my break is enough for me to make a web app on top of this.

Once this is done I'll try doing the same thing in C/C++ because good God mining is expensive enough already we don't need python on top of that.

Hope my break goes well

This is a nice tutorial which I looked at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KARxDX5DTgY
