# my_blockchain
I decided to build a blockchain of my own from scratch because I have nothing else to do in Spring break.

Starting off with python because you don't need a brain to use python. Hopefully my break is enough for me to make a web app on top of this.

Once this is done I'll try doing the same thing in C/C++ because good God mining is expensive enough already we don't need python on top of that.

Hope my break goes well

This is a nice tutorial which I looked at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYasYyjByKI

So I can create accounts, user passwords and make payments. All of this on a flask web app. Yay!

Feel free to use this and try to figure out how to make one yourself! One thing I realised - I only need C/C++ code for the mining part so I can make a function for just that in C and call it.
